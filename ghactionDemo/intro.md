# CI Benchmarking Python scripts using Github Actions, Pytest and Github Pages
In this tutorial you will learn how to create and run a [Github Action](https://github.com/features/actions) that will let you test and compare new versions of you python scripts using [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/). This will help developers easily compare benchmark results and alert on worse performance when making a new push.

This will also introduce [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which lets you host your repository as a webpage directly from Github!

At the completion of this tutorial you'll be able to:

1. Create simple Github Action that will let you test and compare python scripts on pushes
    * With a few modifications you can also implement them for other tasks to enable CI/CD in your other projects! (Pretty cool right!)
2. Create your first Github Page that will display the results from your testing

## So now we're ready, let's get coding!
